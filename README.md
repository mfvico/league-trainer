The aim of this project is to give League of Legends players a resource to track their games, see where their weak points are during games, and get hints as to how to make their game better

This is very much a work in progress, but users will be able to:

View recent games played with their overall CS, Length of game, and various other stats (much like lolking)

Go in depth into the games and see minute by minute stats of said game, which would cover when every aspect of the game occurs

Track their progress and skillset increase

Track what champions the player is best and worst with, and some recommendations for how to get better with them based off game data and standard hints

This is a personal project done in tandem with gSchool, this is not for profit (yet)
